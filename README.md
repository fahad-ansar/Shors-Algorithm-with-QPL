# Shor's Algorithm using Quantum Lang 

It was project under Prof. Michael Winter.

Designed and created a quantum language compiler named 'Quantum Lang'
It is build on top of Java 

Initial Idea was to have a language to have and perform quantum operations in classical systems. Made it Shor's Algorithm oriented i.e. 
It includes all the features required by Shor's Algorithm.

In short,
Shor's algorithm quantum behaviour realized using Classical computing
