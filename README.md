# Shor's Algorithm using Quantum Programming Lang 
Shor's algorithm quantum behaviour realized using Classical computing
It was project under Prof. Michael Winter.
Designed and created a quantum language compiler [in classical computer] named 'Quantum Programming Lang.' on top of Java 
Initial Idea was to have a language to implement and run Shor's Algorithm in classical systems.


## How to run
### Prerequisite
Java JRE
### How to make changes to the QPL file
Refer to Language guide and make changes to 'ShorQ.qpl' 
### Run
go to ./src run Main.java
