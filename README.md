# Shor's Algorithm using 'Quantum Programming Lang'.
Shor's algorithm with Quantum behaviour realized in Classical computer
It was a project with Prof. Michael Winter.
Designed and created a quantum language compiler [in classical computer] named 'Quantum Programming Lang.' on top of Java 
Initial Idea was to have a language to implement and run Shor's Algorithm in classical systems.


## How to run
### Prerequisite
Java JRE 
### Run
go to ./src run Main.java
